_Running CAN and CAN FD on a Mac_ is the mission of the MacCAN project.
There are many companies in the world offering multifarious CAN hardware and CAN software.
Unfortunately, few of them offer a driver for the Mac.

I provide macOSÂ® user-space drivers for the following USB-to-CAN interfaces:

- TouCAN USB Interfaces from Rusoku
- CAN Leaf Interfaces from Kvaser
- PCAN-USB Interfaces from PEAK-System
