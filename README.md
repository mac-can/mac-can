_Running CAN and CAN FD on a Mac_ is the mission of the MacCAN project.
There are many companies offering multifarious CAN hardware and CAN software.
Unfortunately, few of them provide a driver for the Mac.

I provide macOSÂ® user-space drivers for the following USB-to-CAN interfaces:

- [PCAN-USB Interfaces](https://github.com/mac-can/PCBUSB-Library) from PEAK-System
- [TouCAN USB Interfaces](https://github.com/mac-can/RusokuCAN) from Rusoku
- [CAN Leaf Interfaces](https://github.com/mac-can/MacCAN-KvaserCAN) from Kvaser

See the [MacCAN GitHub Pages](https://mac-can.github.io/) website to learn more about the entire MacCAN project and its sub-projects.
